# Diana

Diana is an out-of-the-box fully-fledged GraphQL system for Rust with inbuilt support for commonly-used features like subscriptions and authentication.

## Why?

GraphQL is great, Rust is great! Building a GraphQL server from low-level tooling is cumbersome. Diana solves that by doing all the heavy lifting of boilerplating, authentication, and the like for you, exposing a simple API that allows you to spin up a GraphQL system in no time!

## How do I use it?

TODO once the project is more mature

## Why the name?

*Diana* is the Roman name for the Greek goddess *Artemis*, the sister of Apollo. Apollo is a GraphQL-focused company, and Diana is an open-source GraphQL system for Rust (which Apollo currently doesn't support). Diana has absolutely no affiliation with Apollo the company though!

## Roadmap

* [ ] Write tests for existing code
* [ ] Support authentication over WebSockets for subscriptions
